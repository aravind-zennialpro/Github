PM Modi Embarks on Landmark 5-Nation Tour to Strengthen India’s Global Footprint

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has embarked on a historic five-nation diplomatic tour from July 2 to July 9, 2025 — marking his longest overseas visit since taking office in 2014. The week-long journey will cover Ghana, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Brazil, and Namibia, and reflects India’s growing ambition to cement its leadership role in the Global South and boost strategic ties across continents.

The tour began in Ghana, where PM Modi was received with ceremonial honours and welcomed major investments in education, fintech, and public digital infrastructure. In Trinidad and Tobago, his focus is on strengthening cultural and economic ties with the large Indian-origin diaspora, while advancing cooperation in digital trade, pharmaceuticals, and climate resilience.

In Argentina, PM Modi is expected to hold high-level discussions around lithium sourcing, clean energy partnerships, and agricultural innovation — all of which are crucial for India’s energy and economic security. The Prime Minister will then travel to Brazil to attend the BRICS 2025 Summit, where key topics will include global economic reform, South-South cooperation, and the future of multilateralism in a rapidly shifting geopolitical climate. His final stop, Namibia, will emphasize wildlife conservation efforts, solar energy projects, and collaboration in critical minerals and healthcare.

This ambitious tour reflects India’s push to expand its influence and build sustainable partnerships beyond traditional Western allies. With strategic stops in Latin America and Africa, the visit sends a strong message that India aims to play a proactive role in shaping the global development agenda. PM Modi called the tour a “commitment to shared progress,” reaffirming India's dedication to strengthening diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties with emerging and developing nations.
